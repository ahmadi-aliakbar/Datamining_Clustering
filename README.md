1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Divides data into k clusters by iteratively updating centroids.

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
   - Identifies clusters based on density of data points.

3. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Builds a cluster hierarchy from individual data points.
